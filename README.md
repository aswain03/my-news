# 🗞 Project FakeNews App 🗞

## Background

FakeNews is a webapp full of articles that have been thoroughly researched... It pulls it's data from a specifically made [API](https://project-fakenews.herokuapp.com/api). Users can read, comment and vote on articles that are posted on the app.

</br>

To build the app I have used React with React-Router.

The styling was completed using Styled-Components.
